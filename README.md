# app_prototype_for_students
Here the working model is only for class 10th students as it is a prototype.

You can open the file in any Python IDE but make sure that you have the following libraries installed:
```
import webbrowser
from tkinter import *
import time
import turtle
import pandas as pd
from pandastable import Table
```
Thanks for visiting!


(Don't forget to put the path of the file containing your time table like this(do mention the sheet number and use an excel file only if you don't know how to import csv or txt files): "C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\PycharmProjects\\ATLHackathon\\TIME TABLE IMPLANT - 1.xlsx", "Sheet1")
